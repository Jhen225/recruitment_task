# Recruitment Task

### Requirements
The frontend should be written in React (using Redux will bevery appreciated)

Data from form should be saved in DB

Data from form should be validated before saving

Errors should be handled and displayed for the user

The app must be tested (It's your decision what kind of tests are necessary,please remember that this part of the task is very important to us).

UI is not important for us. You can use your favorite framework(for example Bootstrap) or write everything on your own.
